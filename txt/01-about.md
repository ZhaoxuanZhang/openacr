## About

This is OpenACR, an open-source version of acr, which stands for Auto Cross
Reference, and its related tools.
It is the result of over 10 years of development and
production use. The tools were initially created by Alexei Lebedev at AlgoEngineering
with the goal of helping write low latency software of higher quality.
Subsequently they were licensed to Intercontinental Exchange as part
of a project to rewrite all of NYSE's electronic exchanges.

As of this writing, there are several national electronic markets
written in acr/amc, from matching engines to development tools,
with amc responsible for over 95% of all executable code (>4 million LOC)
and acr handling all configurations.

Since the tools are domain-agonostic, it was decided that open-sourcing
them would be the best way to ensure their longevity and value, and
also a way to give back to the community. After
all, if it weren't for Linux, gcc and the shell, this project wouldn't have
been possible in the first place. And so here we are.

Enjoy,
