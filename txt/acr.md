## acr: Auto Cross Reference

Acr is a query and editing tool for ssim (super-simple) databases.
These databases can be proper directories, or files, or stdin.
Acr is not concerned with big data; it's about small but highly cross-referenced data,
essentially configurations and source code. A rule of thumb is that acr will
process 1 million records/sec and the data sets must fit in memory.

### Querying

The default data directory "data", can be specified with -in option.
Assuming you've successfully built acr, you can type

    $ acr %
    amcdb.curs  curs:curs       comment:""
    amcdb.curs  curs:unordcurs  comment:""
    < about 10,000 more records are printed >

This will dump all records in the data directory, about 10,000 of them.
Of course, once you start growing a real project around this initial deposit,
3,000 fields will seem like nothing.
A large project may easily get 10,000 ctypes, 1,000 ssimfiles and 30,000 fields,
and a few million records.

The query parameter for acr is a SQL regular expression.
SQL regexes are very convenient to use on the command line because they don't
use the whilecard character is `%` instead of `*`, and thus quoting is mostly unnecessary.

You could achieve a similar result to `acr %` by running

    $ find data -name "*.ssim" | xargs cat
    ...

### Creating A New Table

To show the rest of the commands, let's start with a couple of fresh tables
and proceed interactively. We will choose the `dev` namespace; this choice is quite arbitrary.

    $ acr_ed -create -ssimfile dev.a -write
    report.acr_check  records:13  errors:0
    report.acr  n_select:0  n_insert:6  n_delete:0  n_update:6  n_file_mod:1
    report.acr  n_select:624  n_insert:1  n_delete:0  n_update:1  n_file_mod:1
    report.amc  n_cppfile:123  n_cppline:258669  n_ctype:943  n_func:22556  n_xref:460  n_filemod:6

This will create a new empty table data/dev/a.ssim. The ctype for a has a single string field
named 'a'. The fact that this ssimfile was created was recorded in the dmmeta database.
The dmmeta database is how acr knows anything.

    $ acr ssimfile:dev.a
    dmmeta.ssimfile  ssimfile:dev.a  ctype:dev.A
    report.acr  n_select:1  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

### Inserting Data

We can now populate this table with some data. `acr -insert -write` reads values from standard
input, inserts them into the database, and saves everything to disk when done. Duplicate keys
will cause errors. If we need to ignore duplicates, we use `acr -replace -write`.

    $ for X in {0..10}; do echo dev.a a:a$X; done | acr -insert -write
    acr.insert  dev.a  a:a0   comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.a  a:a1   comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.a  a:a2   comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.a  a:a3   comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.a  a:a4   comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.a  a:a5   comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.a  a:a6   comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.a  a:a7   comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.a  a:a8   comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.a  a:a9   comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.a  a:a10  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:11  n_insert:11  n_delete:0  n_update:11  n_file_mod:1

Now let's query this table. Here, we use a SQL regex and ask for values a2, a3 and a4.

    $ acr a:a'(2|3|4)'
    dev.a  a:a2   comment:""
    dev.a  a:a3   comment:""
    dev.a  a:a4   comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:3  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

If we wanted to use these values in a shell script, there are a few flags that help with that.
First, the `-field` option:

    $ acr a:a'(2|3|4)' -field:a
    a2
    a3
    a4

Alternatively, we could ask for a regex of the values:

    $ acr a:a'(2|3|4)' -regxof:a
    (a2|a3|a4)

#### The -replace option

When `-replace` is specified, each new tuple completely overrides the previous tuple. 
Any fields that aren't specified are assigned default values. Let's illustrate by first
creating a temporary table:

    $ acr_ed -create -ssimfile dev.t -write
    ...
    $ acr_ed -create -field dev.T.val -arg u32 -write
    ...
    $ echo 'dev.t t:ggg val:3' | acr -insert -write
    acr.insert  dev.t  t:ggg  val:3  comment:""
    ...
    
Now let's try to insert another record with the value `ggg`:

    $ echo 'dev.t t:ggg' | acr -insert -write
    acr.duplicate_key  key:dev.T:ggg

That failed. Now let's replace instead. This will succeed, and the value `val`
will go back to the default:

    $ echo 'dev.t t:ggg' | acr -replace -write
    ...
    $ acr t
    dev.t  t:ggg  val:0  comment:""
    
#### The -merge option

The `-merge` option is like replace on a per-field basis. Let's illustrate
using the same `t` table. We'll need another column, call it `val2`, while 
set set `val` back to 3:

    $ acr_ed -create -field dev.T.val2 -arg u32 -write
    $ echo 'dev.t t:ggg val:3' | acr -replace -write
    ...
    $ acr t
    dev.t  t:ggg  val:3  val2:0   comment:""
    
So far so good. Now let's use -merge:

    $ echo 'dev.t t:ggg val2:4' | acr -merge -write
    ...
    $ acr t
    dev.t  t:ggg  val:3  val2:4  comment:""

#### The -trunc option

With this option, when the first change is made to the table, the table is first wiped.

    $ echo 'dev.t t:hhh' | acr -insert -trunc -write
    ...
    $ acr t
    dev.t  t:hhh  val:0  val2:0  comment:""


### Generating Shell Scripts

Finally, the `-cmd` option produces an executable shell script which can be piped to `sh`. 
For each record in the final selection, acr outputs variable assignment statements, giving the
shell script access to the values of all field attributes, the fldfuncs, the tuple itsef (`acr_tuple`)
the type tag (`acr_head`) and the rowid (`acr_rowid`). The script can then use whatever 
other Unix tools it needs to.

    $ acr a:a1 -cmd 'echo ==== $a ===='
    acr_tuple=$'dev.a  a:a1  comment:""'
    acr_head=dev.a
    acr_rowid=1
    a=a1
    comment=''
    echo ==== $a ====

Piping through sh produces the desired result:

    $ acr a:a1 -cmd 'echo ==== $a ====' | sh
    ==== a1 ====

The beauty of `-cmd` is that it only creates one subprocess, the target shell. Executing
one command per output row would have been prohibitively expensive.

### Deleting Records From Stdin

The options `-insert`, `-replace`, `-merge` all enable reading of stdin
for a list of tuples. This input stream can contain special lines.

Whenever a line starts with `acr.delete`, the corresponding record is deleted.

Whenever a line starts with `acr.insert`, the corresponding record is inserted (subject to replace/merge semantics).

### Inserting a Column

We now might want to add a column to the `a` table.

    $ acr_ed -create -field dev.A.b -arg u32 -write
    ...

Let's update a few values with `acr -merge`:

    $ echo 'dev.a a:a1 b:55' | acr -merge -write
    report.acr  n_select:0  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:1  n_file_mod:1

Let's check if the b column is there:

    $ acr a | head -3
    dev.a  a:a0   b:0   comment:""
    dev.a  a:a1   b:55  comment:""
    dev.a  a:a10  b:0   comment:""

Yes, it is. What if we just look in the file itself?

    $ head -3 data/dev/a.ssim
    dev.a  a:a0  b:0  comment:""
    dev.a  a:a1  b:55  comment:""
    dev.a  a:a10  b:0  comment:""

We see largely the same result, except the columns are not aligned. By default,
acr flag `-pretty` is set to true, which aligns columns in blocks of 25.

#### The -before option

When creating a new field with `acr_ed`, it can be inserted before another field
by specifying `-before <field>`. Alternatively, you can always call up `acr -t -e ctype:<ctype>`
and make the adjustment by hand, or just go into the `data/dmmeta/field.ssim` table
and swap two lines in a text editor. These are all equally valid approaches.

### Creating a Subset Table

Now let's create another table which will be a subset of the first, and populate it.
When we specify the -subset parameter, we must include the ctype (not ssimfile).

    $ acr_ed -create -ssimfile:dev.b -subset dev.A -write
    ...

Let's quickly check how `B`'s fields were defined:

    $ acr field:dev.B.%
    dmmeta.field  field:dev.B.a        arg:dev.A         reftype:Pkey  dflt:""  comment:""
    dmmeta.field  field:dev.B.comment  arg:algo.Comment  reftype:Val   dflt:""  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:2  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

We see that the field dev.B.a was created, with `arg:dev.A` and `reftype:Pkey`.
`reftype:Pkey` means that the type of the field in question is the same as the type
of the first field of the arg. In this case, `algo.Smallstr50`. It also means, as far as acr
is concerned, that the value of this field must correspond to some existing value in `a`.
Notice that the new table's primary key has the name `a`, not `b`. This
is because of the convention that a foreign key reference uses the name of the target table.
We'll use values a3 through a7.

    $ for X in {3..7}; do echo dev.b a:a$X; done | acr -insert -write
    acr.insert  dev.b  a:a3  comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.b  a:a4  comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.b  a:a5  comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.b  a:a6  comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.b  a:a7  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:5  n_insert:5  n_delete:0  n_update:5  n_file_mod:1

### Following References Up

Now let's see if acr recognizes that these tables are related. We'll use the `-nup 1`
argument to ask acr the following: after locating all records that match the initial query,
follow any of the references 1 level up, extending the selection. At the end, print the result.

    $ acr b:a3 -nup 1
    dev.a  a:a3  b:0  comment:""

    dev.b  a:a3  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:2  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

Yes! It worked. What if we try the same thing when querying a?

    $ acr a:a3 -nup 1
    dev.a  a:a3  b:0  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:1  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

Since `a` doesn't refer to anything, there is nothing to discover.

### Following References Down

But we *can* discover the b record by following from a:

    $ acr a:a4 -ndown  1
    dev.a  a:a4  b:0  comment:""

    dev.b  a:a4  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:2  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

Notice that in the output, `a` is always printed out before `b`. That's because
acr sorts the output so that when it's scanned linearly, referential integrity is
maintained. Acr has a useful shortcut `-xref`, which stands for `-nup 100 -ndown 100`.
And we'll use the `-tree` option, which groups any dependent records underneath the
nearest parent, using indentation. For ssimfiles, indentation is irrelevant when parsing.
Leading whitespace is ignored (very much unlike Python). So the leading whitespace is purely
for human comprehension:

    $ acr b -xref -tree
    dev.a  a:a3  b:0  comment:""
      dev.b  a:a3  comment:""

    dev.a  a:a4  b:0  comment:""
      dev.b  a:a4  comment:""

    dev.a  a:a5  b:0  comment:""
      dev.b  a:a5  comment:""

    dev.a  a:a6  b:0  comment:""
      dev.b  a:a6  comment:""

    dev.a  a:a7  b:0  comment:""
      dev.b  a:a7  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:10  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

Since `-xref -tree` is very frequently used, command line option `-t` is an alias for it.

    $ acr b:a5 -t
    dev.a  a:a5  b:0  comment:""
      dev.b  a:a5  comment:""
      report.acr  n_select:2  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

### Deleting Records

What about deleting records? Let's delete something.

    $ acr a:a4 -del -write
    acr.delete  dev.a  a:a4  b:0  comment:""

    acr.delete  dev.b  a:a4  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:2  n_insert:0  n_delete:2  n_update:0  n_file_mod:1

As you can see, acr followed the reference and deleted the offending b record as well as the
matching a record.

What if we wanted to see what `-del` does without modifying the database?
We could omit the `-write` option. Notice that acr prints the records that *would*
be deleted, but in the final report, `n_file_mod:0` so we know that nothing was written back.

    $ acr a:a5 -del
    acr.delete  dev.a  a:a5  b:0  comment:""

    acr.delete  dev.b  a:a5  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:2  n_insert:0  n_delete:2  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

`-del` works with any number of records. You could delete the entire database with
`acr % -del -write`.

When deleting a field, acr automatically opens and rewrites the corresponding ssimfile.

### Manual Editing

The option -e launches an editor (as specified with the environment
variable EDITOR), allowing you to edit the selected set. When the editor
exits, whatever tuples were in the original selection are deleted from
the ssim files and replaced with the edited output. To abort editing,
kill the editor and remove temporary file temp/acr.ssim.

### Checking Referential Integrity

Let's insert a record into the `b` table which has no corresponding record in the `a` table.

    $ echo 'dev.b a:xyz' | acr -insert -write
    acr.insert  dev.b  a:xyz  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:1  n_insert:1  n_delete:0  n_update:1  n_file_mod:1

Now we have a record referring to a non-existing `xyz`. This is clearly a foreign
key constraint violation, but because we've been running acr with `-check:N` (the default),
the violation was allowed. The reason `acr -check` is off by default is that it's
virtually impossible to interactively build a nice data set without it being `broken` at
one point or another. It's like if your editor disallowed syntactically incorrect programs --
you wouln't be able to even type up "hello world". Usually, it's applications that load
and cross-reference records are the ones that care deeply about constraint violation.

    $ acr -check b
    data/dev/b.ssim:5: Invalid value a:xyz
    dev.b  a:xyz  comment:""

    Type               dev.A
    Valid values       a0, a1, a10, a2, a3, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9

    acr.badrefs  ctype:dev.B  nbad:1

    report.acr_check  records:9  errors:3
    report.acr  n_select:1  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

We wee that acr has detected the error and given us some suggestions on how to fix it.
We can run acr with `-check -e` and delete the record in question.
But we could also delete the offending record, rename it, or insert a missing `a` record.

(Notice that `-check -del` doesn't work as you would expect (this might be fixed later)).

### Renaming

Speaking of renaming, we can rename whole clusters of records with one command:

    $ acr a:a3 -rename a99 -write
    report.acr  n_select:0  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:2  n_file_mod:1

We can check that the dependencies were followed during the rename.

    $ acr a:a99 -t
    dev.a  a:a99  b:0  comment:""
      dev.b  a:a99  comment:""
      report.acr  n_select:2  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

### Cross-Product Types

Now it's time to do something more interesting. We'll create a table `c`, which will be
an independent table; we will populate it with a few colors:

    $ acr_ed -create -ssimfile:dev.c -write
    ...

    $ for X in red green blue; do echo dev.c c:$X; done | acr -insert -write
    acr.insert  dev.c  c:red    comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.c  c:green  comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.c  c:blue   comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:3  n_insert:3  n_delete:0  n_update:3  n_file_mod:1

Now let's create a table `d`, whose key is a cross product of `b` and `c`.

    $ acr_ed -create -ssimfile dev.d -subset dev.B -subset2 dev.C -separator . -write
    ...

    $ for B in a5 a6 a7; do for C in red green blue; do echo dev.d d:$B.$C; done; done | acr -insert -write
    acr.insert  dev.d  d:a5.red    comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.d  d:a5.green  comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.d  d:a5.blue   comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.d  d:a6.red    comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.d  d:a6.green  comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.d  d:a6.blue   comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.d  d:a7.red    comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.d  d:a7.green  comment:""
    acr.insert  dev.d  d:a7.blue   comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:9  n_insert:9  n_delete:0  n_update:9  n_file_mod:1

Now the most interesting part is, how does acr see the resulting structure?
Below we see that acr has followed the schema and discovered all the necessary dependencies,
grouping `d` under `b`, which groups under `a`. All the referenced colors from `c` were
included in the output, but didn't become part of the tree, because only the leftmost
parent is the preferred one.

    $ acr d -t
    dev.c  c:blue   comment:""
    dev.c  c:green  comment:""
    dev.c  c:red    comment:""
    dev.a  a:a5  b:0  comment:""
      dev.b  a:a5  comment:""
        dev.d  d:a5.blue   comment:""
        dev.d  d:a5.green  comment:""
        dev.d  d:a5.red    comment:""

    dev.a  a:a6  b:0  comment:""
      dev.b  a:a6  comment:""
        dev.d  d:a6.blue   comment:""
        dev.d  d:a6.green  comment:""
        dev.d  d:a6.red    comment:""

    dev.a  a:a7  b:0  comment:""
      dev.b  a:a7  comment:""
        dev.d  d:a7.blue   comment:""
        dev.d  d:a7.green  comment:""
        dev.d  d:a7.red    comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:17  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

Let's look at the definition of `dev.D` type. The reason I have been holding off
on showing the definitions of the types `dev.A`, `dev.B`, and `dev.C` is that 
this tutorial is about creating tables and records in these tables,
and type definitions are exactly that -- they're just records inserted by `acr_ed`
into some appropriate tables using `acr -insert -write`.
So it would have been circular to start with them, and I had to hide them.
Seemingly circular definitions occur all the time in acr.
Thankfully, `acr -t` discovers all forward and back references and shows their relationships:

    $ acr ctype:dev.D -t
    dmmeta.nstype  nstype:ssimdb
      dmmeta.ns  ns:dev  nstype:ssimdb  comment:""
        dmmeta.ctype  ctype:dev.D  comment:""
          dmmeta.field  field:dev.D.d  arg:algo.Smallstr50  reftype:Val   dflt:""  comment:""
          dmmeta.field  field:dev.D.b  arg:dev.B            reftype:Pkey  dflt:""  comment:""
            dmmeta.substr  field:dev.D.b  expr:.RL  srcfield:dev.D.d

          dmmeta.field  field:dev.D.c  arg:dev.C  reftype:Pkey  dflt:""  comment:""
            dmmeta.substr  field:dev.D.c  expr:.RR  srcfield:dev.D.d

          dmmeta.field  field:dev.D.comment  arg:algo.Comment  reftype:Val  dflt:""  comment:""
          dmmeta.cfmt  cfmt:dev.D.String  printfmt:Tuple  read:Y  print:Y  sep:""  genop:Y  comment:""
          dmmeta.ctypelen  ctype:dev.D  len:204  alignment:1  padbytes:0

    dmmeta.ssimfile  ssimfile:dev.d  ctype:dev.D
      dmmeta.ssimsort  ssimfile:dev.d  sortfld:dev.D.d  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:13  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

### Fldfunc fields

One thing we see in the print-out above, is that the fields `dev.D.b` and `deb.D.c` are not data
fields. They are defined as subswtrings of `dev.D.d` (the primary key), using expressions `.RL`
and `.RR`. Such computed fields are called fldfuncs. Acr treats fldfunc fields in the same way
as all other fields, but doesn't display them by default unless `-fldfunc` has been specified.
Let's ask acr to show us the fldfunc values:

    $ acr d -fldfunc
    dev.d  d:a5.blue   b:a5  c:blue   comment:""
    dev.d  d:a5.green  b:a5  c:green  comment:""
    dev.d  d:a5.red    b:a5  c:red    comment:""
    dev.d  d:a6.blue   b:a6  c:blue   comment:""
    dev.d  d:a6.green  b:a6  c:green  comment:""
    dev.d  d:a6.red    b:a6  c:red    comment:""
    dev.d  d:a7.blue   b:a7  c:blue   comment:""
    dev.d  d:a7.green  b:a7  c:green  comment:""
    dev.d  d:a7.red    b:a7  c:red    comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:9  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

We can also use `-regx` to quickly confirm which values are present:

    $ acr d -regxof:c
    (blue|green|red)

There are two other types of fldfuncs in addition to substr: bitfields and externally-defined values.
These will be described later.

The expression such as '.RL' is not limited to 3 characters. 

The substr expression consists of triples of characters, where the first character is
what to look for in the string (in this case '.'), the second character is where to start (in this case
start at the right side of the string, 'R'), and the third character specifies what part of the
string to take after the match is found, or the search stops. If the match is not found, search stops
at the opposite end of the string. So, the expression .RL means "Scan from the right until you find the
character or hit the left side of the string. Then, return everything to the right of the current position".
These triples can be repeated as many times as necessary to "bite off" pieces of the string, for example
.RL.RL removes the 2 trailing dots from a string. The corresponding C++ function that implements this
search is called algo::Pathcomp.

The funciton that parses these expressions is called Pathcomp, and we can easily view its source code:

### Querying On Non-Primary Key

It is possible to ask acr to select by a non-primary column. For that, we have to include the full
field name:

    $ acr dev.D.c:blue
    dev.d  d:a5.blue  comment:""
    dev.d  d:a6.blue  comment:""
    dev.d  d:a7.blue  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:3  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

The query string you pass to acr applies not just to the value part, but to the key as well.
So, if we wanted to search both `b` and `c` tables, we'd write:

    $ acr '(c|b)'
    dev.c  c:blue   comment:""
    dev.c  c:green  comment:""
    dev.c  c:red    comment:""

    dev.b  a:a99  comment:""
    dev.b  a:a5  comment:""
    dev.b  a:a6  comment:""
    dev.b  a:a7  comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:7  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

### Sorting & RowIDs

Acr always saves files in sorted order. Sorting is controlled by the `ssimsort`
table, which is a subset of `ssimfile`. Sorting is optional. If `ssimsort` is missing,
the set is *order-dependent*. When sorting is enabled, it can be done on any fields,
including a fldfunc.

Let's take another look at our color table `c`:

    $ acr c
    dev.c  c:blue   comment:""
    dev.c  c:green  comment:""
    dev.c  c:red    comment:""
    report.acr  n_select:3  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

The colors are sorted by name. Let's look at the ctype:

    $ acr ctype:dev.C -t
    dmmeta.ctype  ctype:dev.C  comment:""
      dmmeta.field  field:dev.C.c        arg:algo.Smallstr50  reftype:Val  dflt:""  comment:""
      dmmeta.field  field:dev.C.comment  arg:algo.Comment     reftype:Val  dflt:""  comment:""
      dmmeta.cfmt  cfmt:dev.C.String  printfmt:Tuple  read:Y  print:Y  sep:""  genop:Y  comment:""
      dmmeta.ctypelen  ctype:dev.C  len:204  alignment:1  padbytes:0

    dmmeta.ssimfile  ssimfile:dev.c  ctype:dev.C
      dmmeta.ssimsort  ssimfile:dev.c  sortfld:dev.C.c  comment:""

Now let's delete the ssimsort line.

    $ acr ssimsort:dev.c -del -write
    ...

If we now use `acr -e` to open `c` in an editor, we will see that each line now has an additional
attribute called `acr.rowid`. This is attribute ensures that the line will be saved back to the 
file in the same position.

    $ acr c -e
    <opens EDITOR>
    dev.c  c:blue   acr.rowid:0       comment:""
    dev.c  c:green  acr.rowid:1       comment:""
    dev.c  c:red    acr.rowid:2       comment:""

If we swap the lines for `blue` and `green`, and exit from the editor, no change will 
occur on disk. That's because the order of the records is not determined by their visual order
on the screen. It's determined by the rowid. To swap two records, we would need to swap their rowids.
The rowids are temporary, and exist only for the duration of the editing session. They are not 
saved to the ssimfile.

The type of this rowid is conveniently a `float`, which allows you to insert new lines at fractional positions,
something like this:

    dev.c  c:cyan  acr.rowid:0.5 ...
    ...
    
The very important `dmmeta.field` table is partially positional. It is sorted on the `ctype`
attribute, but not sorted by name. That's because the user needs to control the order of fields
in a structure. Most other ssimfiles are sorted on the primary key.

### Creating A New Data Set

So far, we have been using the default data set called `data`. Acr is not limited to it.
We can work with tuples in any data set, and that data set can be either a directory or a file.

To create a new directory-based data set, we just create an empty directory and then use the `-in`
option:

    $ mkdir x
    $ acr dmmeta.% | acr -in:x -insert -write -print:N
    ...
    $ ls -l x
    total 8
    drwxrwxr-x. 2 alexei alexei 4096 May  2 17:29 dmmeta

All records have now been copiled from `data` to `in`.
As long as we specify the `-in` option, acr will read and write from the specified directory.

### Using A File As A Data Set

We can do the same thing with a file

    $ rm -r x
    $ touch x
    $ acr dmmeta.% | acr -in:x -insert -write -print:N
    ...
    $ ls -l x
    -rw-rw-r--. 1 alexei alexei 735004 May  2 18:00 x

File `x` now contains ssim tuples, one per line, and it can be queried or edited
just like any other data set. Just by dumping some tuples in a file, we get a data set.

### The -schema option

Acr can use and query standard input just like it can a regular file.

    $ echo 'dmmeta.ctype ctype:xyz' | acr -in:- ctype:%
    dmmeta.ctype  ctype:xyz  comment:""

This shows a couple of interesting things. First, acr always displays tuples 
according to the known schema. When printing a tuple, `acr` loops over the 
non-fldfunc fields of the associated `ctype`, and evaluates each field in the context
of the given tuple. This means that acr normalizes data whenever the data is printed.

Second, you might wonder, how does `acr` know that `dmmeta.ctype` has an attribute 
`comment` under these conditions? Well, as it turns out, this is a common problem.
If `acr` loaded its meta-information from the same place it loaded the data, it would
be supremely inconvenient. That's why an additional attribute called `-schema`,
which is equal to `"data"` by default, specifies where to load the schema information.
If we pass an empty data set as schema, we expect nothing to be printed:

    $ rm -r x; touch x  # create a file
    $ echo 'dmmeta.ctype ctype:xyz' | acr -in:- ctype:% -schema:x
    report.acr  n_select:0  n_insert:0  n_delete:0  n_update:0  n_file_mod:0

Sure enough, acr doesn't recognize the input as a valid tuple, so the line is silently
skipped.

### The -meta option

Instead of writing `acr ctype:dev.C -t` we can write

    $ acr c -meta
    dmmeta.ctype  ctype:dev.C  comment:""
      dmmeta.field  field:dev.C.c        arg:algo.Smallstr50  reftype:Val  dflt:""  comment:""
      dmmeta.field  field:dev.C.comment  arg:algo.Comment     reftype:Val  dflt:""  comment:""
      dmmeta.cfmt  cfmt:dev.C.String  printfmt:Tuple  read:Y  print:Y  sep:""  genop:Y  comment:""
      dmmeta.ctypelen  ctype:dev.C  len:204  alignment:1  padbytes:0
        
The `-meta` option looks at the selected records, and de-selects them, and selects their
ctypes instead. `-meta` implies `-t`.

### The -cmt option

The -cmt option displays any comments associated with the current selection. Let's document the dev.C.c
field so that every time `-cmt` is used (and it's on by default whenever `-e` is specified), the 
users gets some help:

    $ echo 'dmmeta.field field:dev.C.c comment:"Name of the color (primary key)"' | acr -merge -write
    $ acr c -cmt
    dev.c  c:blue   comment:""
    dev.c  c:green  comment:""
    dev.c  c:red    comment:""
    
    # Field    Arg              Reftype  Comment
    # dev.C.c  algo.Smallstr50  Val      Name of the color (primary key)

### MySQL Integration

The option -my launches an instance of mariadb and imports all namespaces that cover selected records
as databases into mariadb. It then drops you into a mariadb shell, where you can apply needed transformations.
Upon exit, the data is downloaded from the database back to disk. -my implies -write.
