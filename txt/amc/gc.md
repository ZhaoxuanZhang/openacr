## amc_gc: AMC garbage collector

`amc_gc` is a tool for removing unused records from the dmmeta database.

`amc_gc` takes a target regex and an acr query as an argument. It finds all records
matching the query, then it tries to remove them one by one, and rebuilds the targets
(using abt) in a sandbox dir. If build succeeds with one of the records deleted
it means it wasn't needed in the first place.

Let's illustrate `amc_gc` by creating a new program and inputting a table. 

    $ acr_ed -create -target sample -write
    $ acr_ed -create -finput -target sample -ssimfile dmmeta.ns -write

Since the `ns` table is unused, `sample` will compile even if we remove it. This is the 
case that `amc_gc` detects, and can remove the table:

    $ amc_gc -target:sample -key:ctype:sample.%
    amc_gc.begin  tot_rec:2  n_cppline:259802  watch_cmd:"watch head -50 temp/amc_gc.build"
    amc_gc.analyze  query:dmmeta.ctype:sample.FDb  eliminate:N  rec_no:1  tot_rec:2  n_del:0  n_cppline:259802  n_cppline_del:0
    amc_gc.analyze  query:dmmeta.ctype:sample.FNs  eliminate:Y  rec_no:2  tot_rec:2  n_del:1  n_cppline:259341  n_cppline_del:461
    report.amc_gc  key:ctype:sample.%  n_match:2  n_del:1  n_cppline:259341  n_cppline_del:461

And indeed, `amc_gc` successfully garbage collects the table.
Let's finish by deleting the unused target

    $ acr_ed -del -target sample -write
